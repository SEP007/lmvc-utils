# StringUtils

A set of string utilities for e.g. capitalization or converting strings from dashed to their camelcased equivalent.

Just a set of functions often needed through out every part of the framework and its modules in:

- `camelCaseTo` to replace a delimiter in a string in a way to get a camel cases version
- `camelCaseFrom` to reparse a string with a delimiter into a camel cased version
- `bytes` returns an accurate integer counting the string's length in bytes
